1. pipeline folder is run on a sample 5 percent of podar data, as small as ecoli

2. multi-rename.py in new khmer seems endless, I ran it from old khmer 

3. In IDBA on ecoli, it doesn't form scaffolds, I ran it on contig.fa instead of scaffold.fa, along with an error in the end. The result is in similar size of spades and megahit. The same problem we had with old khmer, noted in one of the ecoli pipeline email.
 you can search idba-quality.log for khmer 100 for more details. 

4. The problem in point 2 doesn't happen with podar sample5per. So I ran podar
and IDBA on the scaffold not contig. Please compare idba-quality.log in ecoli-test and in pipeline. You can see
how the idba behave different on both. 

5. When idba fails to load, many other things fail on HPC at the same time.
So, I don't think its an IDBA problem. The same reason I did not tell you
before. Same for bwa. Usually everything is smooth from dev-intel14.
dev-intel16 is crazy for many times. 
 

6. Please notice module change in pre-idba-quality.sh and idba-quality.sh, idba and khmer don't load with same GNU
same for run-analysis-1.sh and run-analysis-2.sh. 

8. Please take a look into the difference in output of *.dist between ecoli and
sample podar. Also please compare ecoli.qc.coverage to sample5per.qc.coverage
where they are the result of the same python script. 

9. Please take a look at the difference between rule:
megahit-quality-assembly.fa for ecoli and podar in pipeline. Ecoli fails
latter if we cat them. 

10. Some results is here: 
	
*assemblies.stats.QC.AMBIGUOUS.99 
*assemblies.stats.QC.BESTHIT5.99
*assemblies.stats.QC.NOOVERLAP.99
